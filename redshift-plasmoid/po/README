-To translate redshift use the KDE translation software "lokalize", if you can.
-Strictly translate the original sentence without altering it. (Example: do not substitute a comma with a conjunction,
 do not add quotes where they are not present).
 If you think the sentence can be improved, write me and I will update it in the source.
-Do not add leading or trailing spaces except where explicitly required in the comments.
-Respect the capitalization style (Title Capitalization or Sentence capitalization). The comment
 usually should give an hint of the type of capitalization, otherwise look at the original English sentence.
-If a sentence is ambiguous and the comment can't clarify it, write me.
-Read the KDE Human Interface Guideline (HIG). In particular the label and capitalization section.
