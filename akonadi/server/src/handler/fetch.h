/**
  @ingroup akonadi_server_handler

  Handler for the fetch command.

  Request syntax:
  @verbatim
  fetch-request = tag " " [scope-selector " "] "FETCH " scope " " fetch-parameters " " part-list
  scope-selector = [ "UID" / "RID" ]
  fetch-parameters = [ "FULLPAYLOAD" / "CACHEONLY" / "CACHEONLY" / "EXTERNALPAYLOAD" / "ANCESTORS " depth ]
  part-list = "(" *(part-id) ")"
  depth = "0" / "1" / "INF"
  @endverbatim

  Semantics:
  - @c FULLPAYLOAD: Retrieve the full payload
  - @c CACHEONLY: Restrict retrieval to parts already in the cache, even if more parts have been requested.
  - @c EXTERNALPAYLOAD: Indicate the capability to retrieve parts via the filesystem instead over the socket
  - @c ANCESTORS: Indicate the desired ancestor collection depth (0 is the default)
